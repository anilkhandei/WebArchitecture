<p>First things first what is a proxy? A proxy is a computer/server sitting between the source and target computers acting as a coordinator between them.</p>
<p>Basically A Proxy can be of 2 types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Forward Proxy</li>
<li>Reverse Proxy</li>
</ol>
<p>Lets understand each of them one by one.</p>
<h3 id="forward-proxy">Forward Proxy</h3>
<p>The forward proxy sits infront of the client computer, between the client and the internet. Any browsing activity done by the user while connected to the internet is intercepted by the Forward proxy and then routed to the internet.<br>
This has many advantages-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Anonymity:<br>
The internet will be unable to track the IP address of the actual user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caching:<br>
Load time of frequently visited websites can be drastically reduced as the proxy server can cache content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filter Content:<br>
You can add policies to the proxy servers that will block unwanted websites and hence properly manage the content access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access Geo blocked content</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="reverse-proxy">Reverse Proxy</h3>
<p>Reverse proxy is used at the server side, this acts as a middle man between the internet and the Webserver. Like so-</p>
<p>Companies use Reverse proxy for multiple reasons like enabling security for the website. The security overhead can be easily handled at the Proxy server rather than configuring the same at the Web server it self, thereby reducing the server overhead.</p>
